#### My Life Is in Your Hands

Kirk Franklin

    You don't have to worry and don't you be afraid
    Joy comes in the morning, troubles they don't last always
    For there's a friend in Jesus, who will wipe your tears away
    And if your heart is broken, just lift your hands and say:
    "I know that i can make it
    I know that i can stand
    No matter what may come my way
    My life is in your hands"
    You don't have to worry and don't you be afraid
    Joy comes in the morning, troubles they don't last always
    For there's a friend in Jesus, who will wipe your tears away
    And if your heart is broken, just lift your hands and say:
    "I know that i can make it
    I know that i can stand
    No matter what may come my way
    My life is in your hands
    With Jesus i can take it
    With him i know i can stand
    No matter what may come my way
    My life is in your hands"
    So when the tests and trials, may seem to get you down
    And all your friends and loved ones are nowhere to be found
    Remember there's friend in Jesus, who will wipe your tears away
    And if your heart is broken, just lift your hands and say
    "I know that i can make it
    I know that i can stand
    No matter what may come my way
    My life is in your hands
    With Jesus i can take it
    With him i know i can stand
    No matter what may come my way
    My life is in your hands"
